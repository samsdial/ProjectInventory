# Project Requirements: Inventory Management System for an Engineering Company

## 1. Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop an inventory management system for an engineering company. The system will enable efficient management of products, materials, and equipment used by the company, providing a user-friendly and accessible interface for users.

## 2. Project Scope

The project will include the following features:

•⁠ ⁠*Product Module*: Add, edit, delete, and list products in the inventory.
•⁠ ⁠*Stock Control*: Manage product quantities, with alerts for low stock levels.
•⁠ ⁠*Product Categories*: Classify products by type, category, or other relevant criteria.
•⁠ ⁠*Reports and Analysis*: Generate detailed reports on the inventory's status, movements, and trends.
•⁠ ⁠*User Authentication and Authorization*: Control access for different user roles (administrator, regular user).
•⁠ ⁠*Movement History*: Record entries, exits, and modifications in the inventory.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Frontend

•⁠ ⁠*Technology*: React
•⁠ ⁠*Requirements*:

- Responsive and accessible user interface.
- Reusable and performance-optimized components.
- Adherence to UI/UX best practices.

### 3.2 Backend

•⁠ ⁠*Technology*: Node.js and Express
•⁠ ⁠*Requirements*:

- RESTful API for communication with the frontend.
- Efficient handling of requests and responses.
- Basic security implementation (access control and authentication).

### 3.3 Database

•⁠ ⁠*Technology*: MongoDB
•⁠ ⁠*Requirements*:

- Efficient data storage and management.
- Optimized data schema designs for fast operations.
- Support for complex queries and data filtering.

## 4. Functional Requirements

•⁠ ⁠The system must allow user registration and login with different roles.
•⁠ ⁠Users must be able to add, edit, delete, and view products in the inventory.
•⁠ ⁠The system should send automatic notifications when stock levels are low.
•⁠ ⁠Administrators must be able to access detailed inventory reports.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

•⁠ ⁠*Performance*: The system should handle multiple simultaneous requests without affecting response times.
•⁠ ⁠*Security*: Inventory data must be protected from unauthorized access.
•⁠ ⁠*Scalability*: The application should be designed to scale as the number of users or products increases significantly.
•⁠ ⁠*Documentation*: The code should be documented to facilitate maintenance and future updates.

## 6. Optional Requirements

•⁠ ⁠*Testing*:

- Unit tests for both frontend and backend using tools like Jest or Mocha.
- Integration tests to verify the correct communication between frontend and backend.
  •⁠ ⁠*Project Dockerization*:
- Use Docker to create containers for the frontend, backend, and database.
- Configure Docker Compose for service orchestration.
  •⁠ ⁠*Teamwork*:
- The project can be developed individually or in teams of up to 5 members.
- Assign specific roles and tasks within the team to promote collaborative work.

## 7. Project Deliverables

•⁠ ⁠Complete source code for the inventory management system.
•⁠ ⁠Detailed technical documentation of the project’s development.
•⁠ ⁠Instructions for installing and deploying the system.
•⁠ ⁠User manual for administrators and end users.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

•⁠ ⁠The system must be functional and meet all the specified requirements.
•⁠ ⁠The code should be clean, modular, and follow best development practices.
•⁠ ⁠The system must be tested and free of critical errors before the final delivery.
